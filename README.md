This is the source code for my personal website. It uses the [Lanyon](lanyon.getpoole.com) theme for [Poole](getpoole.com), which in turn is based on [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com), a powerful static-site generator.

Feel free to use any of this code for your own personal use, and if you want to reproduce anything from any of my posts, either send me an email asking for permission or link the post up on your page (they're permalinked).
