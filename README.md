=================

This is the source code for my personal website. It uses the [Lanyon](lanyon.getpoole.com) theme for [Poole](getpoole.com), which in turn is based on [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com), a powerful static-site generator.

Requirements
------------

You need `ruby`, `jekyll`, `node` and the gems in `Gemfile`, which can be installed with a simple `bundle install` (requires `bundler`).

Installation
------------

To install this website locally, just run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drewsberry/drewsberry.github.io.git

cd drewsberry.github.io

bundle install

jekyll serve --watch
```

Now you've got it up and running at port 4000! Note that you might have to manually rerun `jekyll build` if you want to make changes to `_config.yml`.
