title: Proper line numbers with Jekyll
permalink: proper-linenumbers
---

By default, Jekyll uses the (excellent) Pygments syntax highlighter for code blocks. While this works well, the line numbers it produces are less than satisfactory.

The default line numbers, `inline`, works, but has two main visual and practical problems:
    * There is no visual separation between the line numbers and the code, causing them to visually become indistinct, and
    * When trying to copy code from the codeblocks, the line numbers are included, annoyingly.
