## About me

I am an undergraduate physics student studying at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom.

## This website

This website is built using [Poole](http://getpoole.com), which is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a great tool for generating static websites such as blogs from Markdown. The theme is [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com), made by [@mdo](http://twitter.com/mdo). This blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), a free, open hosting platform with full Jekyll support (apart from extra plugins). Feel free to have a look at the code for this site on [GitHub](http://github.com/drewsberry/drewsberry.github.io), and use any of it for your own site, if you so desire.

The background image to the sidebar is a fantastic picture taken from the Hubble Space Telescope of the Eagle Nebula, an active star forming region of hot H II gas (or singly ionised hydrogen). The long, delicate pillars of gas are called the "<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eagle_nebula_pillars.jpg#mediaviewer/File:Eagle_nebula_pillars.jpg">Pillars of Creation</a>". Evidence from the [Spitzer infrared telescope](http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/249-ssc2007-01-Famous-Space-Pillars-Feel-the-Heat-of-Star-s-Explosion) suggests that the fragile pillars have already been blown away by a supernova that exploded between 8 and 9 thousand years ago, but that owing to their distance we won't see them crumble for another thousand years. So watch this space, because that's sure to make an amazing sight.
