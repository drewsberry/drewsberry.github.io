## About me

I am an undergraduate physics student studying at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom.

## This website

This website is built using [Poole](getpoole.com), which is built on [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com), a great tool for generating static websites such as blogs from Markdown. The theme is [Hyde](hyde.getpoole.com), made by [@mdo](twitter.com/mdo). This blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages](pages.github.com), a free, open hosting platform with full Jekyll support (apart from extra plugins). Feel free to have a look at the code for this site on [GitHub](github.com/drewsberry/drewsberry.github.io), and use any of it for your own site, if you so desire.
